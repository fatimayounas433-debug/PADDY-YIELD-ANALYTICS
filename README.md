📊 Overview

The Paddy Analytics Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project designed to analyze paddy cultivation and production performance. It presents key agricultural metrics such as Yield Trends, Field Productivity, Crop Health Indicators, and Seasonal Analysis — all organized into a clear and easy-to-interpret dashboard.

This project is suitable for data analysts, agriculture students, and professionals who want to understand data-driven insights in paddy farming using clean dashboard design and structured analysis.

💡 Key Features

📈 Interactive Dashboard – Well-organized visuals for paddy production and crop metrics
🧩 Filter-Based Analysis – Explore insights by season, field, district, or crop type
🌾 Field-Level Comparisons – Identify productivity variations across locations
📊 KPI Cards & Charts – Quick view of essential performance indicators
🔄 Single Data Source Model – All visuals linked to one dataset for easy refresh and updates
